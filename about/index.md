My name is Sander Dieleman. I'm a research scientist at [DeepMind](http://deepmind.com/) in London, UK, where I work on generative modelling and music generation, among other things. Before that, I was a PhD student at [Ghent University](http://www.ugent.be/) in Belgium. On this blog, I mostly write about machine learning, deep learning, music information retrieval (MIR), recommender systems and generative models.

My PhD research topic was learning hierarchical representations of musical audio signals for classification and recommendation, with a focus on *deep learning* and *feature learning*. More information can be found on the [Research](/research) page. The PDF version of my thesis is [available for download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/22bqmco45179t7z/thesis-FINAL.pdf).

During my PhD, I was also quite active on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). A few write-ups about my experience with Kaggle competitions are available on this blog. I was also one of the lead developers of the Theano-based neural network library [Lasagne](https://github.com/Lasagne/Lasagne).
